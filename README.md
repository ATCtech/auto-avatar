# auto-avatar
A python script that changes the profile picture from all of the social media accounts (twitter,facebook, Instagram,youtube...) of a user together.\
So one wont have to change all of em one by one ðŸ˜œ.\
Kinda useful for lazy people like me.\

## Basic Idea
The user will provide a profile picture and the info needed to login and update the social media profile, and the script will change the profile picture of all social media accounts at once.

## Instructions
Feel free to fork this repo and add your ideas and probably some code to make this work.\
The preferred language is **Python** coz it's easily understandable and powerful, but you may also do so in other languages, but be sure to make a language specific folder and add the instructions to run your code.
